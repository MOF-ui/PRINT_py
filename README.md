# General

PyQT5-based python-ui to remote-control an ABB robot arm, mortar pumps,
admixture pumps and DAQ devices in order to 3D print conrete/mortar
on a large scale

Hi! First of all: be careful with this program. Keep in mind, that it 
controls a very large robot arm that can easily cause a lot of damage. 
Also, I am not a programmer (nor is english my first language for that
matter). Therefore, you can not count on me following standard industrial
procedures or that all of the docstrings convey the meaning I intended.
I tried to build this application according to the standards that I know
of, though. You can write me issues, I'll see to them, if I find the time.

## File structure

#### gh (Grashopper)

> grasshopper scripts used to extract control points as list or
> GCode from one or multiple Rhino3D curve objects either controlled
> by minimum control points per degree of curviture (with or without
> alternating curve seams) or with unidistance mode

#### libs (libraries)

> actual software libraries for PRINT_py, libs with the "win" prefix
> control the GUIs, TCP and COM interfaces are scripted in
> threads.py

#### mtec (modified from m-tec-com)
 
> Modbus interface for mtec P20 & P50

#### simCom (virtual robot)

> used for simplified integration tests

#### test (not up-to-date)

> unittests fÃ¼r most libs

### ui (GUIs)

> Qt designer files and pyuic5 outputs

## Scope

This programm was written to remotely control the second robot arm
(Roboter 2) of the instituts robotic cell. The robot arms were
manufactured by ABB while all of their subroutines were programmed by
Klero Roboter Automatisation from Berlin. This code requires a TCP/IP
interface running on the robot, which takes 159 byte commands. The robot
can either act upon them immediately or buffer up to 3000 commands. The
current version runs on 10 forwarded commands, which goes easier on the
robots internal route planning. While the interface is connected the robot
sends positional data (36 byte blocks) around every 0.2 seconds. Additionally,
PRINT_py controls 2 mtec P20 or P50 mortar pumps and maybe an inline mixing
device in the future:

# Usage

start with 'py .\PRINT.py'
you can also start a testing environment with:
        - start a virtual robot with 'py .\simCom\test_server.py'
        - start PRINT_py in local mode with 'py .\PRINT.py local'

Pumps currently connected via COM port using a USB001Z-3 USB-to-Serial
conversion unit. Both pumps are connected via Modbus, sharing the same bus
and therefore the same COM port. Modbus adresses are '01' & '02'. There is 
no testing environment for the pumps, yet.
